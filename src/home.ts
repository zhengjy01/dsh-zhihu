/**
 * dsh-zhihu — DeepSeek Harness home resolution.
 *
 * The plugin owns `<DSH_HOME>/dsh-zhihu.json` (mode 0600) and the
 * `<DSH_HOME>/dsh-zhihu/` scratch directory. Neither may be derived from a
 * hardcoded `~/.dsh`.
 *
 * Resolution order (per the DSH plugin portability checklist):
 *   1. the plugin's own override — a full path, used by tests / throwaway
 *      instances / per-plugin relocation;
 *   2. `DSH_HOME` — a launcher or a rescue capsule may relocate the whole
 *      home, and the host sets `DSH_HOME` before loading plugins;
 *   3. `~/.dsh` — the conventional machine-wide location.
 *
 * Hardcoding `~/.dsh` silently writes a second, wrong home on a relocated
 * setup (the plugin then "loses" its config), so all owned paths go here.
